        <p>
          Every player starts with the white (or light) color square in the
          bottom right-hand square of the chessboard.
        </p>
        <img

        <p>
          The chess pieces are then always placed in the same configuration.
          There are pawns in the second row (or rank). The rooks go in the
          corners, followed by the knights beside them, the bishops, and lastly
          the queen, who always goes on her corresponding color (black queen on
          black, white queen on white), with the king going on the last square.

        <h3><a id="step2">Step 2: How The Chess Pieces Move</a></h3>
        <p>
          Every one of the six types of pieces moves in a unique way. Pieces are
          never allowed to move onto a square that contains one of their own
          pieces, nor can they pass through other pieces (although the knight
          can leap over other pieces). They can, however, be moved to replace a
          piece that an opponent has captured after it has been moved.
          Generally, pieces are placed so they can control key squares in the
          game, defend themselves against capture, or capture other pieces by
          landing on their square and then replacing them.
        </p>
        <br />
        <img src="/IMG/moving-pieces.jpg" alt="" style="width: 300px" />

        <h4>How to move the Pawn</h4>
        <p>
          Pawns are unique in that they move forward but capture diagonally,
          which is a different way of moving and capturing. Pawns can only
          advance one square at a time, with the exception of their initial
          move, which allows them to advance two squares. Only one diagonal
          square can be captured by pawns in front of them. They are unable to
          move or move backward. A pawn is unable to move past or capture a
          piece that is placed directly in front of him.
        </p>

        <h4>How to move the Knight</h4>
        <p>
          Knights move very differently from other pieces; they move in a
          straight line for two squares and then make one more move at a
          90-degree angle, forming an L. Knights are also the only pieces that
          can move over other pieces.
        </p>

        <h4>How to move the Bishop</h4>
        <p>
          The bishop can move in any direction, but only in a diagonal path.
          Every bishop must always remain on the same color—either light or
          dark—from the beginning. Bishops complement one another well by
          covering one another's weaknesses.
        </p>

        <h4>How to move the Rook</h4>
        <p>
          The only directions the rook can move are forward, backward, and to
          the sides. When the rooks are cooperating and defending one another,
          they are especially strong pieces!
        </p>

        <h4>How to move the Queen</h4>
        <p>
          The most powerful piece is the queen. She can move as far as she can
          in any straight direction, as long as she avoids going through any of
          her own pieces. These directions include forward, backward, sideways,
          and diagonal. The queen's move ends if she captures an opponent's
          piece, just like it does with other pieces.
        </p>

        <h4>How to move the King</h4>
        <p>
          Despite being one of the weakest pieces, the king is the most crucial.
          The king can only go one square in all directions, including
          diagonally, up, down, and sideways. The king might never put himself
          in a position where he could be apprehended. This is known as a
          "check" when the king is under attack from another piece.
        </p>

        <!----Step 3: Discover The Special Rules Of Chess---->
        <h3><a id="step3">Step 3: Discover The Special Rules Of Chess</a></h3>
        <p>
          Chess has a few unique rules that might not make sense at first. They
          were developed in order to add interest and fun to the game. These
          rules are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Castling</li>
          <li>Promotion</li>
          <li>"En Passant"</li>
        </ul>

          <a id="step4">Step 4: Find Out Who Makes The First Move In Chess</a>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Every time, the player using the white pieces moves first. Therefore,
          in most games, the decision of who gets to be white is made by chance
          or happenstance, such as when a coin is flipped or a player is asked
          to guess the color of a hidden pawn in the other player's hand. After
          that, until the game is over, white moves first, then black, then
          white again, and so on. The small advantage of being able to move
          first allows the white player to launch an immediate attack.

        <!----Step 6: Review The Rules Of How To Win A Game Of Chess---->
        <h3><a id="step6">Step 6: Study Basic Chess Strategies</a></h3>
        <p>
          There are four simple strategies that every chess player should know:
        </p>
        <h4>Protect Your King</h4>
        <p>
          Get your king to the corner of the board where he is usually safer.
          Don't put off castling. You should usually castle as quickly as
          possible. Remember, it doesn't matter how close you are to checkmating
          your opponent if your own king is checkmated first!
        </p>
        <h4>Don't Give Pieces Away</h4>
        <p>
          Try not to lose your pieces! You need all of the pieces to checkmate
          in order to win a game, and each piece has value. Most players use a
          simple system to remember how much each chess piece is worth in
          relation to the others. What is the value of the chess pieces?
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A pawn is worth 1 point</li>
          <li>A knight is worth 3 points</li>
          <li>A bishop is worth 3 points</li>
          <li>A rook is worth 5 points</li>
          <li>A queen is worth 9 points</li>
          <li>The king is infinitely valuable</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These points have no impact on the outcome of the game; they are just
          a tool for decision-making during gameplay, assisting you in
          determining when to capture, trade, or execute other actions.
        </p>
        <h4>Control The Center Of The Chessboard</h4>
        <p>
          With your pieces and pawns, you should attempt to take control of the
          center of the board. Controlling the center will give you more space
          to maneuver your pieces and make it more difficult for your opponent
          to locate advantageous squares for his pieces. In the aforementioned
          example, black plays poor moves while white makes smart moves to
          control the center.
        </p>
        <h4>Use All Of Your Chess Pieces</h4>
        <p>
          When your pieces are relegated to the first row, they are of no use.
          In order to have more pieces available for the king attack, try to
          develop every piece you have. Attacking with one or two pieces will
          not work against any competitive opponent.
        </p>
