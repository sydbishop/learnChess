    <h2><a id="step1">Step 1: How To Setup The Chessboard</a></h2><br>
    <p>
      Every player starts with the white (or light) color square in the bottom
      right-hand square of the chessboard.
    </p>
    <img src="" alt="" />
    <p>
      The chess pieces are then always placed in the same configuration. There
      are pawns in the second row (or rank). The rooks go in the corners,
      followed by the knights beside them, the bishops, and lastly the queen,
      who always goes on her corresponding color (black queen on black, white
      queen on white), with the king going on the last square.
    </p>
    <h3>Pieces today</h3>
    <p>There are 6 chess pieces today, they are:</p>

    <!----Step 2---->
    <h2><a id="step2">Step 2: How The Chess Pieces Move</a></h2><br>
    <p>
      Every one of the six types of pieces moves in a unique way. Pieces are
      never allowed to move onto a square that contains one of their own pieces,
      nor can they pass through other pieces (although the knight can leap over
      other pieces). They can, however, be moved to replace a piece that an
      opponent has captured after it has been moved. Generally, pieces are
      placed so they can control key squares in the game, defend themselves
      against capture, or capture other pieces by landing on their square and
      then replacing them.
    </p>
    <h3>How to move the Pawn</h3>
    <p>
      Pawns are unique in that they move forward but capture diagonally,
      which is a different way of moving and capturing. Pawns can only
      advance one square at a time, with the exception of their initial
      move, which allows them to advance two squares. Only one diagonal
      square can be captured by pawns in front of them. They are unable to
      move or move backward. A pawn is unable to move past or capture a
      piece that is placed directly in front of him.
    </p>
    <h3>How to move the Knight</h3>
    <p>
      Knights move very differently from other pieces; they move in a
      straight line for two squares and then make one more move at a
      90-degree angle, forming an L. Knights are also the only pieces that
      can move over other pieces.
    </p>
    <h3>How to move the Bishop</h3>
    p>
          The bishop can move in any direction, but only in a diagonal path.
          Every bishop must always remain on the same color—either light or
          dark—from the beginning. Bishops complement one another well by
          covering one another's weaknesses.
        </p>
    <h3>How to move the Rook</h3>
    <p>
      The only directions the rook can move are forward, backward, and to
      the sides. When the rooks are cooperating and defending one another,
      they are especially strong pieces!
    </p>
    <h3>How to move the Queen</h3>
    <p>
      The most powerful piece is the queen. She can move as far as she can
      in any straight direction, as long as she avoids going through any of
      her own pieces. These directions include forward, backward, sideways,
      and diagonal. The queen's move ends if she captures an opponent's
      piece, just like it does with other pieces.
    </p>
    <h3>How to move the King</h3>
    <p>
      Despite being one of the weakest pieces, the king is the most crucial.
      The king can only go one square in all directions, including
      diagonally, up, down, and sideways. The king might never put himself
      in a position where he could be apprehended. This is known as a
      "check" when the king is under attack from another piece.
    </p>

    <!----Step 3: Discover The Special Rules Of Chess---->
    <h3><a id="step3">Step 3: Discover The Special Rules Of Chess</a></h3>
        <p>
          Chess has a few unique rules that might not make sense at first. They
          were developed in order to add interest and fun to the game. These
          rules are:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li><b>Castling</b></li>
          <p>
            One unique chess rule is known as castling. With this move, you can
            potentially accomplish two key objectives in one move: moving your
            rook out of the corner and into play, and hopefully getting your
            king to safety. A player may move his king two squares to one side
            during his turn, and he may then move the rook from the corner of
            that side to the square directly next to the king on the other side.
            (See the video below.) But in order to castle, the following
            requirements have to be fulfilled:
          </p>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>it must be that king's very first move</li>
            <li>it must be that rook's very first move</li>
            <li>
              there cannot be any pieces between the king and rook to move
            </li>
            <li>the king may not be in check or pass through check</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>
            You'll notice that the king is closer to the side of the board when
            you castle in one direction. We refer to that as "kingside" casting.
            Castling "queenside" refers to casting to the opposite side, through
            which the queen sat. When castling, the king always moves only two
            squares, regardless of which side is involved.
          </p>

          <br />
          <li><b>Promotion</b></li>
          <p>
            A pawn's ability to become any other chess piece, with the exception
            of a king, is a unique ability known as promotion. If a pawn reaches
            the other side of the board, then this ability activates and allows
            the pawn to change.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            A pawn is able to become a queen, rook, bishop, or knight. It's a
            frequent misperception that pawns can only be traded for captured
            pieces. That is untrue. Typically, a pawn advances to a queen. You
            can only promote pawns.
          </p>
          <br />
          <li><b>"En Passant"</b></li>
          <p>
            Another pawn rule is known as "en passant," which translates to "in
            passing" in French. The other pawn can choose to capture the first
            pawn as it moves past if the pawn moves out two squares on its first
            move and lands to the side of the opponent's pawn, effectively
            jumping past its ability to be captured. Once the first pawn has
            moved past, you have to make this special move right away or else
            you will lose the opportunity to capture it.
          </p>

    <h2><a id="step4">Step 4: Find Out Who Makes The First Move In Chess</a></h2><br>
    <p>
      Every time, the player using the white pieces moves first. Therefore, in
      most games, the decision of who gets to be white is made by chance or
      happenstance, such as when a coin is flipped or a player is asked to guess
      the color of a hidden pawn in the other player's hand. After that, until
      the game is over, white moves first, then black, then white again, and so
      on. The small advantage of being able to move first allows the white
      player to launch an immediate attack.

    <!----Step 6: Review The Rules Of How To Win A Game Of Chess---->
    <h2><a id="step6">Step 6: Study Basic Chess Strategies</a></h2>
    <p>
      There are four simple strategies that every chess player should know:
    </p>
    <h3>Protect Your King</h3>
    <p>
      Get your king to the corner of the board where he is usually safer.
      Don't put off castling. You should usually castle as quickly as
      possible. Remember, it doesn't matter how close you are to checkmating
      your opponent if your own king is checkmated first!
    </p>
    <h3>Don't Give Pieces Away</h3>
    <p>
      Try not to lose your pieces! You need all of the pieces to checkmate
      in order to win a game, and each piece has value. Most players use a
      simple system to remember how much each chess piece is worth in
      relation to the others. What is the value of the chess pieces?
    </p>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>A pawn is worth 1 point</li>
      <li>A knight is worth 3 points</li>
      <li>A bishop is worth 3 points</li>
      <li>A rook is worth 5 points</li>
      <li>A queen is worth 9 points</li>
      <li>The king is infinitely valuable</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>
      These points have no impact on the outcome of the game; they are just
      a tool for decision-making during gameplay, assisting you in
      determining when to capture, trade, or execute other actions.
    </p>
    <h3>Control The Center Of The Chessboard</h3>
    <p>
      With your pieces and pawns, you should attempt to take control of the
      center of the board. Controlling the center will give you more space
      to maneuver your pieces and make it more difficult for your opponent
      to locate advantageous squares for his pieces. In the aforementioned
      example, black plays poor moves while white makes smart moves to
      control the center.
    </p>
    <h3>Use All Of Your Chess Pieces</h3>
    <p>
      When your pieces are relegated to the first row, they are of no use.
      In order to have more pieces available for the king attack, try to
      develop every piece you have. Attacking with one or two pieces will
      not work against any competitive opponent.
